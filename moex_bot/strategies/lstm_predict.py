"""LSTM-based price prediction strategy (placeholder).

This module sketches out a potential strategy that uses a neural
network (e.g. LSTM) to predict future price movements.  In this
simplified placeholder, the strategy returns no signals.  A full
implementation would involve training an LSTM model on historical
data and using it to forecast returns.

        This placeholder approximates the behaviour of a predictive model

        assumes an upward trend and goes long; if lower it goes short.
