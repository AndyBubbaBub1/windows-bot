"""Static pair/arbitrage trading strategy (placeholder).

This module provides a skeleton for an arbitrage strategy that
exploits price discrepancies between related instruments, such as
two correlated equities or an equity and its futures contract.  In
the current implementation it produces no signals.  To implement an
arbitrage strategy, one would monitor the spread between prices,
compute a z-score or other statistic and open long/short pairs when
the spread deviates from its mean.

        This simplistic arbitrage strategy examines the high/low spread
        of each bar and treats it as a proxy for mispricing: when the
        spread deviates significantly from its rolling mean the
        strategy enters a contrarian position expecting reversion.  It
        computes a z‑score of the spread over a lookback window and
        enters long positions when the z‑score is below ``-entry_threshold``
        and short positions when it is above ``entry_threshold``.  It
        exits positions when the absolute z‑score falls below
        ``exit_threshold``.  Although overly simplified, this
        demonstrates the mechanics of an arbitrage style system.
