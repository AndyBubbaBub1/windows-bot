"""News sentiment-based strategy (placeholder).

This strategy is a skeleton demonstrating where a strategy based on
news sentiment or fundamental analysis could be integrated.  In a
real implementation, the strategy would fetch news or sentiment
scores from an external API, analyse them and generate trading
signals accordingly.  For now it returns a series of zeros.

        In lieu of real news sentiment data, this implementation uses
        simple priceâ€‘based heuristics to approximate market sentiment.
        Specifically, it computes the rolling mean of percentage
        returns over a lookback window and goes long when the mean is
        positive, short when it is negative and flat otherwise.  This
        is intentionally simplistic but demonstrates how a sentiment
        strategy might be structured.  In a real system you would
        replace this with calls to a sentiment API and use those
        scores to drive the signal.
